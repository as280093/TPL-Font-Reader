> A web tool that finds missing fonts in Tool Presets(.tpl) files.

---

So, here's the deal: I use Photoshop a lot, and something that really annoys me is when I install a new .tpl file, and some fonts are missing. Photoshop doesn't even bother telling me‚Äîit just switches everything to Myriad Pro like nothing happened. And honestly, that's super frustrating.

I got tired of guessing what fonts were missing and manually fixing things, so I decided to make this little tool. It's simple: it helps you figure out what fonts are missing from your .tpl files so you don't have to deal with surprises or wasted time.

I made this for myself initially, but if it helps someone else too, then that's even better! üòä
